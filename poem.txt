Act 5 Scene 5

Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
Until the last syllable of recorded time
And all our yesterday's have lighted fools the way to dusty death
Out, out brief candle
Life is but a walking shadow
A poor player that strut's and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more
It is a tale told by an idiot
Full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing



 
 I have no spur	 
 	To prick the sides of my intent, but only	 
 	Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself	 
 	And falls on th'other.

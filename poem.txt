Act 5 Scene 5

Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
Until the last syllable of recorded time
And all our yesterday's have lighted fools the way to dusty death
Out, out brief candle
Life is but a walking shadow
A poor player that strut's and frets his hour upon the stage
And then is heard no more
It is a tale told by an idiot
Full of sound and fury
Signifying nothing

I have seen them
Riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black

We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
With sea girls wreathed with seaweed
Red and brown
Till human voices wake us and we drown.
